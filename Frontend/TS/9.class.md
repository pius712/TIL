## Classes

아래의 문법처럼 사용할 수 있다. 

```ts
class Greeter {
  greeting: string;
  // 위는 public field로 contructor에서 따로 초기화하지 않으면
  // 생성된 객체에서는 { greeting: undefined }로 나온다. 
  constructor(message: string) {
    this.greeting = message;
  }
  greet() {
    return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
  }
}

let greeter = new Greeter("world");
```


## 상속(Inheritance)

상속을 통해서 기존의 클래스를 확장시킬 수 있다. 

```ts
class Animal {
  move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {
    console.log(`Animal moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  bark() {
    console.log("Woof! Woof!");
  }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.bark();
dog.move(10);
dog.bark();
```

클래스는 프로퍼티와 메서드를 base 클래스로부터 
This example shows the most basic inheritance feature: classes inherit properties and methods from base classes. Here, Dog is a derived class that derives from the Animal base class using the extends keyword. Derived classes are often called subclasses, and base classes are often called superclasses.

Because Dog extends the functionality from Animal, we were able to create an instance of Dog that could both bark() and move().

Let’s now look at a more complex example.

```ts
class Animal {
  name: string;
  constructor(theName: string) {
    this.name = theName;
  }
  move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {
    console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);
  }
}

class Snake extends Animal {
  constructor(name: string) {
    super(name);
  }
  move(distanceInMeters = 5) {
    console.log("Slithering...");
    super.move(distanceInMeters);
  }
}

class Horse extends Animal {
  constructor(name: string) {
    super(name);
  }
  move(distanceInMeters = 45) {
    console.log("Galloping...");
    super.move(distanceInMeters);
  }
}

let sam = new Snake("Sammy the Python");
let tom: Animal = new Horse("Tommy the Palomino");

sam.move();
tom.move(34);
```

This example covers a few other features we didn’t previously mention. Again, we see the extends keywords used to create two new subclasses of Animal: Horse and Snake.

One difference from the prior example is that each derived class that contains a constructor function must call super() which will execute the constructor of the base class. What’s more, before we ever access a property on this in a constructor body, we have to call super(). This is an important rule that TypeScript will enforce.

The example also shows how to override methods in the base class with methods that are specialized for the subclass. Here both Snake and Horse create a move method that overrides the move from Animal, giving it functionality specific to each class. Note that even though tom is declared as an Animal, since its value is a Horse, calling tom.move(34) will call the overriding method in Horse:

Slithering...
Sammy the Python moved 5m.
Galloping...
Tommy the Palomino moved 34m.
